 1. Fundamentals of Machine Learning - Intro to Scikit Learning

      a. Why is it important to examine your dataset as a first step in applying machine learning:
        - See what type of cleaning or preprecessing still needs to be done
        - You might notice missing data
        - Gain insight on what macihne learning model might be appropirate, if any
        - Get a sense for how difficult the problem might be
  
       b. Nearest neighbor classifier: memorize the entire training set

2. Supervised Machine Learning - Part 1
   
   Key Concepts
     a. Understand how different supervised learning algorithms - in particular, those based on linear models - estimate their own    parameters from data to make new predictions.
     b. Understand the strengths and weaknesses of particular supervised learning methods in order to apply the right algorithm for a given task.
     c. Apply specific supervised machine learning algorithms in Python with scikit-learn.
     d. Recognize general principles of supervised machine learning that are common across algorithms, such as the connection between model complexity and generalization performance.
     e. Apply techniques like regularization, feature scaling, and cross-validation to avoid common pitfalls like under- and overfitting.

3. Evaluation
   
   Key Concepts
     a. Understand why accuracy alone can be an inadequate metric for getting a more complete picture of a classifier's performance
     b. Understand the motivation and definition of a variety of important evaluation metrics in machine learning and how to interpret the results of using a given evaluation metric
     c. Optimize a machine learning algorithm using a specific evaluation metric appropriate for a given task
