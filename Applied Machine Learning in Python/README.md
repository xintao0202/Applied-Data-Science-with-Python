 1. Fundamentals of Machine Learning - Intro to Scikit Learning

      a. Why is it important to examine your dataset as a first step in applying machine learning:
        - See what type of cleaning or preprecessing still needs to be done
        - You might notice missing data
        - Gain insight on what macihne learning model might be appropirate, if any
        - Get a sense for how difficult the problem might be
  
       b. Nearest neighbor classifier: memorize the entire training set
