Week 1: Principles of Information Visualization
Key Concepts
- Choose a graphic that displays misleading information
- Interpret the features of the graphic in order to identify the mechanism(s) that is/are used by the "encoder" to mislead the "decoder"
- Analyze the graphic and use principles from Alberto Cairo's work to explain how the graphic is misleading
- Create a radar plot in order to reflect on the complexity of the misleading graphic

Week 2: Basic Charting
Key Concepts
- Work with real world CSV data
- Know how to create a line graph using matplotlib
- Manipulate data to get the minimum and maximum temperature
- Demonstrate procedure of composite charts

  Assignment: [Plotting Weather Patterns](Assignment2.ipynb)

Week 3: Charting Fundamentals
Key Concepts
- Build more complex features using base features (i.e., artists)
- Create new ways of visualizing the data by expanding the matplotlib codebase 
- Use subplots to combine plots into a single figure
- Create insightful plots such as histograms, box plots, and histograms 
- Create animated and interactive visualizations

  Assignment: [Becoming a Custom Visualization](Assignment3.ipynb)

Week 4: Applied Visualizations
Key Concepts
- Identify two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension
- State a research question that can be answered using two publicly accessible datasets
- Create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question
- Justify how the visual addresses your research question
